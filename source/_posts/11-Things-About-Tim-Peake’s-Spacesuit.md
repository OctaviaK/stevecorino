This is actually the Sokol KV-2 emergency spacesuit worn by Uk ESA Astronaut Tim Peake as he traveled into space.

Today Tim's suit joined the Science Museum Group Collection and you can view it on display in the Museum of Science and Industry found in Manchester from 10 March 2018.

Strap in as we share 11 factual statements about this impressive space survival system:

1. The Sokol KV-2 emergency suit is certainly put on by cosmonauts (and astronauts) during launches to the International Space Station and the return to Earth.
2. The Sokol suit (Sokol may be the Russian word for Falcon) originated by the RD&PE Zvezda provider following the loss of the three-cosmonaut crew of Soyuz 11 in 1971. The crew were not using spacesuits when their spacecraft depressurised during its return to Earth.
3. Made to prevent a repeat of the Soyuz 11 tragedy, the suit was presented in 1973 to hold cosmonauts alive in the event of accidental depressurisation. The primary release was the Sokol-K.
4. Zvezda modified its high-altitude aviation suit to create the Sokol and prepared it for spaceflight. Rigid, removeable helmets were changed by softer, built-in types. This and other changes made the Sokol convenient and enabled near-prompt sealing of the suit when the helmet visor was shut.
5. The suit comprises of a rubberised internal bladder and a rigid exterior coat. The bladder has an airtight seal (employing an elastic band) and the exterior coat is made largely from the temperature-stable insulator Kapton to supply safety from mechanical and thermal effect.
6. Every Soyuz crew member will get a made-to-measure suit. It's essential that it meets properly-each cosmonaut spends one hour in a start seat with the suit inflated to make certain it suits. Arm, leg and chest straps allow the suit to be modified.
7. To get into the Sokol suit, two zips that form a zip on the upper body are opened up. Underneath, there can be an opening in the inner rubberised bladder known as the appendix. Hip and legs go in first, accompanied by the arms in to the sleeves and go to the helmet.

An airtight seal is manufactured by tightly rolling up the appendix and securing it with rubber bands. This can be fastened beneath the V shaped flap in the suit's external layer. The suit's detachable gloves are secured with anodised aluminium bayonet fixings.
8. The suit's polycarbonate visor opens on hinges mounted near the ears and seals with an anodised aluminium clavicle flange when closed. The hood or 'fender helmet' folds up when the visor is elevated.
9. Footwear are worn only through the walk to the Soyuz spacecraft, to safeguard your feet of the go well with from damage. Cosmonauts frequently carry children's toys and gifts in them for luck, then take the boot styles off in order to avoid trailing debris into the spacecraft.
10. Once the astronaut/cosmonaut is normally in the Soyuz spacecraft, electrical and air source lines and hoses will be connected to the lower abdomen portion of the suit. Linked to the spacecraft's lifestyle support systems, the Sokol suit provides two hours of oxygen and carbon-dioxide removal if the spacecraft cabin depressurises.
11. The Sokol go well with is contoured for the Soyuz spacecraft seats, which require cosmonauts to pull their knees up into a foetal placement. This shape triggers the 'cosmonaut stoop' seen when cosmonauts are taking walks to the Soyuz spacecraft.

Tim's Sokol KV-2 emergency spacesuit is currently on screen at the Museum of Research and Industry found in Manchester where it could been seen with the Soyuz spacecraft Tim travelled found in within the National Tour of Tim Peake's Spacecraft presented by Samsung and the Technology Museum Group.

This is not the first spacesuit to become listed on the Research Museum Group Collection. We likewise look after Helen Sharman's Sokol spacesuit (currently on screen in the museum's Exploring Space gallery). Sharman was the primary Briton in space and wore her go well with while travelling to and from the Russian Mir space station in 1991.
